## README

This project lets you search through [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) (n√©e 37signals) archive. Right now it searches their [current blog](https://m.signalvnoise.com), [archives](https://signalvnoise.com/archives/), [older archives](https://signalvnoise.com/older_archives.php), [Getting Real](http://gettingreal.37signals.com), and the [37signals manifesto](https://37signals.com/manifesto).

It's still an initial exploration, so watch out for some rough edges. Feel free to email me any suggestions at [elomar@elomar.me](mailto:elomar@elomar.me).
